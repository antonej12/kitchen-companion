<h2>Co-op Work Experience</h2>

 - Software Engineer Co-op, KLH Engineers (Fall 2019)
	 - Supported the development team through testing, debugging, revising, and writing of software source code used for maximizing business process and engineering efficiencies as well as customer service and product quality.
	 - Worked primarily in Microsoft Visual studio writing VB.NET source code.
	 - Gained experience working with user interfaces, specifically winforms and WPF, and the connections between front-end and back-end.
 - IT Quality Assurance Co-op, Gulfstream Aerospace (Spring 2018)
	 - Assisted QA lead with executing testing activities within the development and implementation of the software development lifecycle.
	 - Gained experience from the testing perspective with regards to the software development cycle.
 - UC Covid-19 Experiential Explorations Program (Summer 2020) 
	 - Because of the cancellation of my co-op with KLH Engineers due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I completed an EEP experience for my final co-op.
	 - This included using "upskilling" opportunities to hit a certain number of hours of self-learning.
	 - This experience gave me a lot of freedom to pursue various technical skills, allowing me to strengthen areas I have had experience in, and to gain introductory experience in areas I have no prior experience with.
	 - I used my experience to dive much deeper into Python, which I already had a lot of experience with, and to learn new skills like Javascript, C#, Microsoft Azure to name a few.

<h2>Project Sought</h2>
Based on my co-op experience with KLH Engineers, I would enjoy projects that would put me in the software development/software engineering side of things. However, I also wouldn't mind being a part of a project that allows me to explore new/less familiar material like machine learning, web development, or data analysis.

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
Python, Javascript, VB.NET, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, C#, SQL
