## Managing Ingredients
There are many features of this application designed to help its users keep an organized pantry full on ingredients. In order to start managing your ingredients, use the bottom navigation bar to go to the Ingredients section of the application. This section is where you will see all the ingredients you have at your disposal!
### Adding Ingredients

To add new ingredients to your stock, simply click the plus icon located near the bottom right of the screen. You will be redirected to a new screen where you can enter information about the ingredient you wish to add. There are two ways to go about adding new ingredients into your pantry. The first would be through manual entry. You will need to fill out text fields for the ingredient's name and the amount of the ingredient you have. A dropdown menu containing the type of supported unit types is located next to the amount text field. After entering all the required information, hit the save button located in the top-right of the menu bar, and you should now see your newly added ingredient in the ingredients screen.

Another option you have to add ingredients is to use the built-in barcode scanner. This scanner can be launched via the barcode button located at the bottom middle of the screen. This button will start the scanning process, and you will need to align the barcode you wish to scan within the area shown through the camera. Upon a successful scan, you will be prompted with a pop-up containing information about the ingredient you just scanned; if everything looks correct, hit the green check mark and you are good to go! You should see you newly added ingredient listed correctly in the ingredients screen.

### Editing Ingredients
If you need to update an ingredient's name or change the amount that you have, you can either swipe right on the ingredient you wish to edit, or simply click on it. Doing either action will take you to the ingredient's details where you can change whatever you need to, from the ingredient's name to its amount or unit type. Once you are done making changes, click the save button located in the top-right of the menu bar to save your changes. You should see those changes immediately take place in the ingredients screen.

### Deleting Ingredients
Deleting ingredients in Kitchen Companion has never been easier. Simply swipe left on any ingredient you decide is no longer good enough to be included with the rest of your ingredients and it will be removed.

## Managing Recipes
Keeping track of all of your recipes is simple to do within Kitchen Companion. Navigate to the recipes screen by clicking on the left recipes button located on the bottom navigation bar. Here is where you will see all of the recipes you have saved!

### Adding Recipes 
*-subject to change as development completes-*
If you want to add a new recipe, simply click the plus button located near the bottom right of the recipes screen to launch the recipe editor and get started. Within the recipe editor, you will first need to add all of the ingredients required for the recipe. There will be a small plus icon within the ingredients table that you can click to add an empty row to the table. Enter information for one ingredient into one row within the table and carry out that process for each ingredient. When you are done adding ingredients, hit the next button to move on to adding steps for the recipe. Adding steps will be very similar to adding ingredients; simply click the plus button within the table to add a new row and enter the step information into each row of the table. You can make as few or as many steps as you like; if you prefer a single step that has all the information about the recipe, go for it! after filling out all the steps, hit the finish button. You should now see your newly added recipe in the recipes screen!

### Editing Recipes
If you need to edit a recipe, you can either click on the recipe or swipe right on the recipe. Clicking the recipe will first take you to a screen where you can view information about the recipe where you will then need to hit the edit button located in the menu bar, whereas swiping right will take you directly to the recipe editor.

Once in the recipe editor, you will see a table of ingredients just like when adding ingredients to a recipe. You can edit each ingredients information such as amount or unit type, as well as delete ingredients entirely or even add new ones. Once you are done editing the ingredients, hit the next button and you will now be able to edit the recipe's steps. This works exactly like editing ingredients, where you can edit steps, delete steps, or add new steps. Once you are done editing everything, hit the finish button to save all the changes.

### Deleting Recipes
When you want to remove a recipe from your recipes screen, you can simply swipe left on the recipe you wish to remove and it will be deleted. You can also click on the recipe to enter the viewing screen, and then from there, click the delete button located in the menu bar to delete the recipe.

### Viewing Recipes
To get a more detailed view on a recipe, simply click on it. This will allow you to see all the ingredients required to cook the recipe as well as all the steps. This recipe view screen also has men bar buttons to edit the recipe, delete the recipe, and to cook the recipe, a feature that will be discussed down below.

## Get Cooking!
When it is time to start cooking, you can use the bottom navigation bar and select the cook option. This screen will show you all of the recipes you have the ingredients for. There are filters and a search bar that can be used to filter down what recipes are shown. When you decide on one that looks appetizing, click on it! This will launch the cooking activity, showing you what ingredients you need to get prepared, and letting you walk through the recipe step by step as you cook. Once you are finished cooking the recipe, hit the finish cooking button and Kitchen Companion will automatically update your ingredient stock, taking out what you just used for that recipe! The cooking activity can also be started by viewing a recipe in the recipes screen and clicking the cook button in the menu bar if you already have an idea of which recipe you want to cook.
