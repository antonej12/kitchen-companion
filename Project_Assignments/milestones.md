<h2>Milestones</h2>

 **1. Research/Investigate all fields and topic areas**
Research all areas of the project like front-end, back-end, and database platforms/frameworks and decide on what technologies to used. This may or may not include more advanced features like web scrapping for recipes, barcode scanning, etc. depending on time. 
Expected completion date: 12/06/20

**2. Create barebones Android app that supports user accounts**
Create a simple application that will serve as the baseline for future additions. The app must allow user logins and any database infrastructure needed to support that will obviously need to be completed.
 Expected completion date: 01/10/21

**3. Implement database for storing ingredients and recipes**
Have the database setup and running which will be responsible for storing user's ingredient stock and recipe lists. 
Expected completion date: 01/24/21

**4. Implement ingredient stock input feature**
Users will be able to input ingredients into their stock and edit/remove things as well. These will be stored in the database on a per user basis. 
Expected completion date: 02/7/21

**5. Implement recipe input feature**
Users will be able to input recipes that will be saved to their account and edit/remove recipes as well. These will be stored in the database on a per user basis. 
Expected completion date: 02/21/21

**6. Achieve MVP with addition of recipe by ingredients feature**
Add the functionality to retrieve/display recipes from the user's recipes based on the user's ingredients. This addition will lead the a minimum viable product for the project. 
Expected completion date: 03/7/21

**7. Add barcode scanning functionality to the ingredient input process**
Adding this functionality will allow users to have a better workflow for inputting their ingredient stock and is definitely something I want to achieve for this project, but as of right now, I haven't delved deep enough to determine how likely/possible this feature would be. It isn't a necessary feature to have a working, useable application in my opinion, but I think it greatly benefits the user experience. 
Expected completion date: 04/18/21

**8. Complete extensive testing of the application**
Test all systems/pieces of the application to make it as-bug free as possible before looking to add more advanced features. 
Expected completion date: 04/4/21

**9. Add advanced features**
Any further features can look to be worked on and potentially added after extensive testing is passed. An example here would be scrapping web recipes for results instead of just using the user's database. I have included the barcode scanner in its own milestone for reasons mentioned above. 
Expected completion date: 04/4/21 - Future
