# Project Description
Choosing recipes to cook, specifically during a busy work week, can be hard and tiresome. Even if you have an idea of what you want to eat, you might find out that you are missing a key ingredient, making the process of choosing what to cook even more frustrating. 
Kitchen Companion is a mobile application that helps alleviate any stress when it comes to figuring out what to cook. It will allow users to keep track of what ingredients they have available and give them recipes to cook based on what they have. 
By using kitchen companion, users will spend less time trying to figure out what they can cook, and more time eating delicious meals.

Kitchen Companion is an Android application that allows users to keep track of what ingredients they have in their kitchen, save recipes to a recipe book, and get recipes from their recipe book based on the ingredients they have in their kitchen. This project aims to get more people into cooking at home by helping alleviate any stress that comes with deciding what to cook.

# User Interface Specification

<img src="files/ui_main.jpg" alt="Main Screen" width="200"/>  <img src="files/ui_recipes.jpg" alt="Recipes Screen" width="200"/>  <img src="files/ui_ingredients.jpg" alt="Ingredients Screen" width="200"/>  <img src="files/ui_view_recipe.jpg" alt="View Recipe Screen" width="200"/>

Above are some screen captures from the application that give an idea on how the user interface is designed for this project. Navigation between the main activities is done from the Bottom Navigation bar as can be seen in the first three screenshots. Card views along with recycler views are used for the three main activities when generating the content of these activities. This includes recipe cards for the recipes screen, ingredient cards for the ingredients screen, and cookable recipes for the cook screen. These cards are fully swipeable (details of these actions can be read about in the user manual). Activities that go further into details from the three main activities, like the fourth screenshot which is viewing a recipe's details, utilitize the menu bar to hold actions that can be done.
